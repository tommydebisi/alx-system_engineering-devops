- The elements added were firewall, SSl certificate and monitoring tools. firewall is needed in the system as it is used to filter the user/client request from the public network(Internet) to the private network. Firewall also protects the server from malicious content and cyber attacks.
    SSL certificate is needed for secure connection, it's needed most especially if a user is entering card details it'll prevent the detail from being intercepted by a cyber attacker
    Monitoring tools are key tools needed to read and record metrics then alert if the server cpu or disk space is running based on the configuration.

- Firewalls are needed to filter the trafic coming to a server from the public network to private network
- Traffic is served over HTTPS to ensure secure connection
- The monitoring tool reads and records the metrics of each server and alerts if there's an issue or potential issue
- To monitor the QPS (Queries Per Second) i'd make use of the appropraite monitoring tool for that.


Issues with the infrastructure
- Terminating at the load balancer level is an issue because there's a chance of the message to be intercepted by a cyber attacker
-  Having one MySQL database accepting writes is an issue because it the database crashes the application can't get the user's data again from the database till the issue is solved.
- Servers with same components are not sharing the same file system but are at the same time sharing the same data because of constant update in the slave server.
